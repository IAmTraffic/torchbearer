# Ivy's Torchbearer

This is an unofficial Foundry VTT system for [BWHQ's Torchbearer](https://www.burningwheel.com/torchbearer/).

This system is made by a fan of the game, and is not associated with BWHQ in any way. If you are a member of BWHQ and have any issues with my doing this, please reach out to me.

## Installation

Clone this repository into your FoundryVTT/Data/systems folder. Close Foundry (if it is open), and reopen it. If you see "Ivy's Torchbearer" listed under your game systems, then it is successfully installed.

## Getting Started

Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/IAmTraffic/torchbearer/wiki) for some guides on the basic functionality of this system. If there's something confusing that isn't explained on the wiki, please submit an issue (see below) and I'll do my best to clarify. 

## Found a bug? Have a suggestion?

Please submit [an issue](https://github.com/IAmTraffic/torchbearer/issues) and I'll get on it when I'm able. This is a one-dev project, so I can't make any promises, but I will do my best.
